** This is the design document for Schedule Generator ** 

Considerations (Algorithm):
 - Schedule should be generated with a random seed
 - Every team has to play every other team at least once
 - Each team plays each division rival twice
    --> Division games are special cases
 - Division rivals are played in the 1st three weeks and the last three weeks of the season
    --> Weeks 1-3 and weeks 11-13 are special cases
 - Checks in place to make sure these considerations are met
 - Display schedule

Considerations (GUI):
 - Let user choose the number of teams to enter
 - Let user choose the number of divisions (2 or 4)
 - Let user choose if they want division scheduling (special cases for playing division rivals and weeks 1-3, 11-13)
 - Display week by week schedule with nice formatting
 - Export to CSV?
