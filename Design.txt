** This is the design document for Schedule Generator ** 

Considerations:

 - Each team plays each division rival twice
 - Division games are played in the frist 3 weeks and last 3 weeks of the season
 - Display schedule

Considerations (GUI):

 - Let user choose the number of divisions (2 or 4)
 - Let user choose if they want division scheduling (special cases for playing division rivals and weeks 1-3, 11-13)
 - Display week by week schedule with nice formatting
 - Export to CSV?

Libraries:
